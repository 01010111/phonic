  - [ ] I don't care for that font (even though I know it's what we use on the BOB page and you were probably just being consistent). Is it Arial? Could we use the same font that used inside of the games? It feels softer to me and les condensed.
  - [x] I would choose for the box to be less long- so shorter vertically. 
  - [ ] I'd like to see some icons added for each sound for a visual piece
  - [x] I was confused by the Play icon for the timer being the same as the Play buttons for each sound. I was trying to play the sounds from the bottom, then figured out it was to start the timer. I'd suggest a different button here to be more clear that it's for the timer.
  - [x] Does the little clock icon on the left serve as just an indicator that it's the timer section?  I wonder if that could be used instead of the play triangle to start the timer.
